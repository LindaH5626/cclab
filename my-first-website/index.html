                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Hearty doesn't have any biological family. It only has "brothers and sisters" that were made in the same batch as it.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Hearty can only live in a pure black liquid environment. Because it can't help constantly spreading out Hype Factors. And this pure black liquid is the only thing that can stabilize the Hype Factors and keep it from leaking out.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Hearty is a heart with a completely smooth surface. There are no irregularities on its surface. It spreads the green Hype Factors outward depending on how active it is.</p>

                Hearty was found in an abandoned bunker. According to the scientific team that first explored the bunker, it was built by a billionaire to treat his rare heart condition. Researchers working in the bunker have been hired by the mad billionaire to build him an artificial heart that will never rest. Hearty was one of the last tests they made. The billionaire wanted the heart to be full of energy, so the researchers created a Hype Factor to power the heart. To keep the heart in perpetual motion, researchers have come up with an ingenious way to make it generate its own Hype Factor. This allows Hearty to generate and absorb while maintaining its own permanence.
But the experiment was probably a failure.
When the last batch was discovered, Hearty exploded as soon as someone tried to remove it from the vessel filled with black liquid. The grapevine says that's why the experiment stopped and the bunker was abandoned. It was when Hearty came into contact with air that a small explosion seriously injured two researchers, and the experiment was suspended altogether. Because at least 20 Hearty were produced in the same batch, they could not be disposed of and ended up being locked underground along with the bunker forever.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>So far, we haven't found a way to expose Hearty to the air. But we can already interact with Hearty by changing the flow of pure black liquid. The Hearty was placed in a glassware connected to a computer. When you pressed the "A" button, the fluid flowed faster, causing Hearty to think it was under attack, and when you pressed the "D" button, the fluid flowed slower, causing Hearty to be calmed and throated more slowly.
